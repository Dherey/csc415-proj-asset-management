2. View all assets that have been assigned to them.
3. Show requests they've made

The HR unit's dashboard should, 
1. Show all requests made by employees
2. Allow them to manage employees(create new employee, view all employees, update employee details, delete employee)

The manager's dashboard should
1. Show the statuses of all requests
2. Allow the manager to approve or decline requests.

In addition to the dashboards the web application should have pages for managing office items and their assignments.
